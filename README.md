### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chen Liang, you can call me Max if you like or Ruyyi (though I don't even know how to pronounce this one, I just feel like this is an interesting name). I am a **Data Scientist** which currently building service focusing on the job market, I am also trying to gain some experience and knowledge on **Machine Learning Engineer**, which I actually loves this one more.

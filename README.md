### Hi there 👋

My name is Chen Liang, you can call me Max if you like or Ruyyi (though I don't even know how to pronounce this one, I just feel like this is an interesting name). I am a **Data Scientist** which currently building service focusing on the job market, I am also trying to gain some experience and knowledge on **Machine Learning Engineer**, which I actually loves this one more.

Compared to working on hard and complex problems, I like to gather and organize some code snippets which I created, previously found or used, and then share to people. I found joy and useful when I got connected into this coding world by many people trying to share their knowledge, though it's super easy and simple. Now I want to do the similar stuff, just to keep help you, me and all the programmers keep the original love to the coding, no matter what you're doing, and what programming language you use. 

### This is what I've worked on 🔭

**Data Scientist** | @_[BurningGlass](https://www.linkedin.com/company/burning-glass-technologies/mycompany/) Jul. 2019 - Present_

I've joined BurningGlass data science team, focusing on building the machine learning models and machine learning pipeline along with them, in order to help the company utilize the job market information to produce market analysis and trend prediction. 
- During this time, I'm the main contributor to a millions level project, produced and delivered a feature fusioned machine learning model to give good salary estimation from a given job posting. This model reduce the error percentage by 1/3 compared to previous version of it, and earn the retention of some big clients like Ranstad. 
- Other than this, I am now working jointly with my collegues on creating a general automated machine learning pipeline to serve the whole model training procedure to multiple models that the team has developed.

### My education background 📖

**Other Certifications**
* [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/R9JKDQE957GL)

### Stuff to share with you 💬 
* [Shadowlands](https://www.notion.so/ruyyisme/Shadowland-3117bf3dc60b4206acecd99d2f46ef3a) This is a notion notebook that I used for saving some of the commonly used code snippets / functions or small tips, hope it can be somehow help if you are just start some simple coding XD.
* [Commit Message Quality Checker](https://github.com/ruyyi0323/Udacity-ML-Engineer-Capstone-Project) This is actually the capstone project repo that for the ML Engineer Nanodegree, but currently I decided to expand a little bit and keep going to upgrade the procedure, so I am putting this in here. If you're looking for AWS sagemaker deployment script which uses tensorflow, you may want to check this out :D

### Fun facts 😄 ...
- I like to **drive around** as trip, this is the way I like the most when speaking to explore the world.
- I like to look for a best place to **film plane and train**, architectures, not using the professional cameras, just a simple iPhone.
- I played **WOW** for nearly 6 years
